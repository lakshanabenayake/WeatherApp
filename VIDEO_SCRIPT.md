## Recording Tips

### Video Settings:
- **Orientation:** Portrait (for phone) or Landscape (for demo)
- **Resolution:** 1080p minimum
- **Format:** MP4 (most compatible)
- **Duration:** Keep under 60 seconds

### Best Practices:
✅ Use screen recording software (Android built-in screen recorder, AZ Screen Recorder, or scrcpy)  
✅ Keep audio clear (avoid background noise)  
✅ Speak at a moderate pace  
✅ Ensure text is readable (don't zoom out too much)  
✅ Practice the sequence 2-3 times before final recording  
✅ Edit out any pauses or mistakes (use video editor if needed)  

### What MUST Be Visible:
1. ✅ Student index input field
2. ✅ Computed latitude and longitude
3. ✅ "Fetch Weather" button being tapped
4. ✅ Weather data (temperature, wind, code, time)
5. ✅ **Request URL (very important!)**
6. ✅ Airplane Mode icon/toggle
7. ✅ Error message
8. ✅ "(cached)" tag on cached data

## Alternative 45-Second Version (Faster Pace)

If you need to fit everything in 45 seconds:

- **0:00-0:08** (8s): Show app, index, and coordinates
- **0:08-0:20** (12s): Fetch weather and show results + URL
- **0:20-0:30** (10s): Enable Airplane Mode and show error
- **0:30-0:43** (13s): Show cached data with tag
- **0:43-0:45** (2s): Quick closing

---

## Troubleshooting

### If recording exceeds 60 seconds:
- Speed up your narration slightly
- Cut out pauses between actions
- Use video editing software to trim dead time
- Skip the introduction, go straight to demonstration

### If app doesn't show cached data offline:
- Make sure you successfully fetched weather at least once before testing offline
- Check that the error message appears (this confirms offline state)
- The cached data should appear automatically below the error

### If request URL is not visible:
- Scroll down in the app to reveal it
- It's at the very bottom in a small, monospace font
- Zoom in slightly if needed for recording
